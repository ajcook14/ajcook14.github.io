            <p class="lead">I am a mathematician, computer scientist, hobbyist, and sailor. I am passionate about the use of data in modelling physical systems, particularly in relation to forecasting. My mathematical interests include topology, geometry, quantum computing, computer assisted proofs, artificial intelligence, and dynamical systems. I also love thinking about the wind, the weather, and design and performance of airfoils and watercraft in competitive and non-competitive sailing</p>
